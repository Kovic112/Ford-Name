          The fourth generation Ford Mustang is an automobile that was produced
          by the American manufacturer Ford for the 1994 through 2004 model
          years. For 1994 the Ford Mustang underwent its first major redesign in
          fifteen years, being introduced in November 1993 and launching on
          December 9, 1993.

          The design, code named "SN-95" by Ford, was based on an updated
          version of the Fox platform, the final Ford vehicle underpinned with
          this platform. It featured styling by Bud Magaldi that incorporated
          some stylistic elements from the classic Mustangs. A convertible
          returned, but the previous notchback and hatchback bodystyles were
          discontinued in favor of a single fastback coupe bodystyle.

          Prior to the redesigned Mustang's launch, a two-seater show car was
          designed by Darrell Behmer and Bud Magali. Called the Mustang Mach
          III, it was shown at the 1993 North American International Auto Show
          in Detroit and hinted at what the new production Mustang would look
          like. The Mach III featured a supercharged 4.6 L DOHC V8 with 450 hp
          (336 kW; 456 PS). While this engine was not put into production, it
          hinted to the future use of Ford's Modular V8 in the Mustang,
          including the eventual use of a supercharged 4.6 L V8.
