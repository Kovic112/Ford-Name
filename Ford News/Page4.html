              The sixth generation Mustang was unveiled on December 5, 2013, in
              Dearborn, Michigan; New York, New York; Los Angeles, California;
              Barcelona, Spain; Shanghai, China; and Sydney, Australia. The
              internal project code name is S-550.

              Changes include widened body by 1.5 inches, 1.4 inches lower body,
              trapezoidal grille, and a 2.75-inch lower decklid, as well as new
              colors. The passenger volume is increased to 84.5 cubic feet,
              wheelbase is still 8 ft. 11.1 in. (107.1 in.), and three engine
              options are available: a newly developed 2.3 L EcoBoost 310 hp
              four-cylinder introduced to reach high tariff global markets like
              China, 3.7 L 300 hp V6, or 5.0 L Coyote 435 hp V8, with either a
              Getrag six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission with
              paddle shifters.

          A new independent rear suspension (IRS) system was developed
          specifically for the new model. It also became the first version
          factory designed as a right hand drive export model to be sold
          overseas through Ford new car dealerships in right hand drive markets.
          During this model year, left hand drive versions were expanded to new
          export markets.
