          Reviewer Prefers V8 Engine Over 2020 Ford Mustang EcoBoost HPP
        </header>

        <p>
          After spending a week with a fully-loaded 2020 Ford Mustang HPP,
          Travis from SVT Performance can’t make a case for the
          handling-oriented spec over the Coyote V8-engined GT optioned with the
          Performance Pack Level 2. The GT PPL2 has been discontinued, though,
          late in 2020.

          The Blue Oval pulled the plug on the ultimate version of the GT after
          revealing the Mach 1, which is now the king of Coyote-powered ponies.
          The Mach 1 also replaces the Shelby GT350 and GT350R, which is a bit
          of a bummer considering the loss of the Voodoo flat-plane crankshaft
          motor.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is, however, a bit of an elephant in the room. Ford is charging
          $4,995 for the High Performance Package, which develops 332 horsepower
          and 350 pound-feet (475 Nm) of torque. The Focus RS used to crank out
          350 horsepower, which means that someone has artificially dialed back
          the HPP for whatever reason. As for the Velocity Blue example in the
          following videos, the sticker price can be described as overly
          exaggerated at $43k.
        </p>

        <p>
          Capable of 270 horsepower and 335 pound-feet (454 Nm) of torque at the
          rear wheels, the reason this HPP is dramatically expensive in
          comparison to a V8-engined model is the number of options that help
          with handling and daily driving. In no particular order, the two-door
          coupe from Flat Rock, Michigan is kitted with the Equipment Group 201A
          at $2,200, the EcoBoost Handling Package at $1,195, and Recaro
          body-hugging bucket seats at $1,995.
        </p>

        <p>
          The verdict? Well, it’s pretty obvious from the headline, isn’t it? “I
          do like this car, but I just don’t think it’s for me,” said Travis
          from SVT Performance.
