          The sixth generation Ford Mustang (S550) is the current iteration of
          the Mustang pony car manufactured by Ford. In departure from prior
          Mustang models, the sixth generation Mustang includes fully
          independent rear suspension on all models, as well as an optional 2.3L
          EcoBoost turbocharged and direct injected four cylinder engine.
        </p>

        <p>
          The new Mustang was introduced as a 2015 model year vehicle, marking
          the fiftieth anniversary of the Ford Mustang, which was revealed as a
          1965 model year vehicle on April 17, 1964.
        </p>

        <p>
          The sixth generation is also the first Ford Mustang to be marketed and
          sold globally, and represented the first time that factory right hand
          drive Mustangs were produced in addition to the left hand drive
          models. This is part of the "One Ford" business plan, which also
          applies to the Fiesta, Focus, Fusion/Mondeo, Escape/Kuga, Edge, Ford
          Transit Connect, and Ford Transit, as well as other models.
