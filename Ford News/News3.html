          The Ford Mustang Is The Best-Selling Sports Car For The Sixth Year In
          A Row
        </p>

        <p>
          Ford released the numbers for both the fourth quarter and for the 2020
          year and it revealed that Mustang sales totaled 61,090 for the year,
          marking its sixth straight year as America’s best-selling sports car.
          Mustang also finished the final quarter on total sales of 13,453 cars.
          At retail, Mustang sales were up 14.8 percent for the quarter.
          Combined Q4 retail sales of Shelby GT350 and GT500 increased 36
          percent, with retail sales up 14 percent for the year.

        <p>
          I wrote a eulogy and tribute to the GT350 as one of the best Mustangs
          Ford has produced in a long time. It is being discontinued. The
          Mustang Mach 1 will replace it in the stable. And Ford will continue
          to produce the Mustang GT500 as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          Car sales in general are down significantly across the board due to
          the pandemic. That’s only natural. So Mustang having the lowest units
          sold ever is not as dire as it sounds. And truth be told Mustang sales
          are only down 15 percent compared to last year where Ford sold 72,489
          units.
        </p>

        <p>
          But you can’t also dismiss the significant drop in sales for the
          Mustang and the entire muscle car/sports car segment. It’s sort of a
          dying breed.
