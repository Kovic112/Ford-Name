          The second-generation Ford Mustang, marketed as the Ford Mustang II,
          is a two- or three-door, four passenger, front-engine/rear-drive pony
          car manufactured and marketed by Ford from 1973 to 1978. Introduced in
          September 1973 for model year 1974, the Mustang II arrived roughly
          coincident with the oil embargo of 1973 and subsequent fuel shortages.
        </p>

        <p>
          490 pounds lighter and almost 19 inches shorter than the 1973 Mustang,
          the second generation was derived from the subcompact Pinto platform
          using a unique unibody with an isolated front suspension and engine
          mount subframe while sharing a limited number of chassis and driveline
          components. The steering was improved from the previous generation by
          using a rack-and-pinion design
        </p>

        <p>
          Named Motor Trend's 1974 Car of the Year and reaching over 1.1 million
          sales over four years of production, the Mustang II is noted
          simultaneously for both its marketing prescience and strong sales â€”
          while regarded by certain enthusiasts as having abandoned essential
          aspects of the Mustang heritage and in a retrospective after 40 years
          since its introduction described as embodying the Malaise era.
