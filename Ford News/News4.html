        <p>
          The Ford Mustang is a lot of things: American icon, muscle car, pony
          car, fastback, and now an electric car with the 2021 Ford Mustang
          Mach-E. It's easy to overlook the Mustang in one of its best forms,
          however, as a convertible. With a 6.2 out of 10 TCC Rating (read more
          about how we rate cars) the drop top Mustang edges out the Mazda MX-5
          Miata as our Best Convertible To Buy 2021.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unlike the Miata, there are four seats in the Mustang, but those rear
          seats are better for handbags than humans. There are other compelling
          convertibles, including the 2021 Chevy Corvette, BMW Z4, Mercedes-Benz
          C-Class, and others that don't qualify for our award because they cost
          more than $50,000. The 2021 Mustang convertible starts just over
          $33,000 and can be had with one of two potent engines and either a
          lovely 6-speed manual or 10-speed automatic transmission.
        </p>

        <p>
          The 5.0-liter V-8 that makes 460 horsepower and 420 pound-feet of
          torque with the standard 6-speed manual is the obvious choice for that
          all-American V-8 rumble and a 0-60 mph time under 4.0 seconds with the
          $5,195 Performance Package. It adds 19-inch aluminum wheels, front
          splitter, rear wing, larger front springs and bigger brakes, but it
          takes the price above $50,000. The 2.3-liter turbo-4 with a 10-speed
          automatic transmission can also be had with a Performance Package to
          optimize power and grip, while still keeping the price under $40,000.
          It boosts output from 310 hp to 330 hp and lowers 60 mph times from
          the mid 5 seconds to the mid 4 seconds.
        </p>

        <p>
          The independent suspension makes the rear-wheel drive Mustang sharper
          on the track and comfier while cruising, where the convertible is at
          its best. Plastic covers have to be removed from above the rear seat
          area, and a roof latch must be turned before pushing the button to
          drop the soft top, which can be done at speeds no more than 3 mph. The
          upside is the convertible can still stow 11.4 cubic feet of space in
          the trunk, which is at least 50% more than in the Chevy Camaro or
          Miata.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Mustang looks even better with the soft top down. Its long nose,
          twin peak hood, standard 17-inch alloy wheels and long wheelbase evoke
          an even greater sense of freedom without a top. Inside doesn't appeal
          as well, with its hard dull plastics everywhere. But that can be
          optioned up to soft-touch surfaces, from cloth to leather seats,
          carbon fiber trims, an available 8.0-inch touchscreen with Apple
          CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, and an available 12.0-inch
          digital instrument cluster.
        </p>

        <p>
          The 2021 Ford Mustang convertible combines the power of a muscle car
          with the open sky fun of a drop top. It's a hoot.
