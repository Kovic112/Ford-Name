          John Najjar was an American designer and executive stylist at Ford
          Motor Company. He is credited for having co-designed the first
          prototype of the Ford Mustang known as Ford Mustang I with Philip T.
          Clark.

          Najjar was born to a working-class Greek Orthodox Christian Lebanese
          family in Omaha, Nebraska. He joined Ford Motor Company's Apprentice
          School in Dearborn, Michigan. While working there as a machinist, he
          was approached by Henry Ford during a plant tour who asked him if he
          enjoyed his work. Najjar's response that he'd "rather be drawing cars"
          led to an invitation for him to add his talents to Ford's newly
          created Design Center.

        <p>
          The Advanced Styling Studio developed the 1962 Ford Mustang I concept
          car - so named because of his love for its namesake, the North
          American P-51 Mustang fighter plane. His design contributions span
          decades and include the M4A3 Sherman tank and B-24 bomber in the
          1940s, the 1957-58 Lincoln Continentals, the Mercury XM-800, the
          LevaCar concept.
