              The Ford Mustang is a series of American automobiles manufactured
              by Ford. In continuous production since 1964, the Mustang is
              currently the longest-produced Ford car nameplate. Currently in
              its sixth generation, it is the fifth-best selling Ford car
              nameplate. The namesake of the "pony car" automobile segment, the
              Mustang was developed as a highly styled line of sporty coupes and
              convertibles derived from existing model lines, initially
              distinguished by "long hood, short deck" proportions
            </p>

              Originally predicted to sell 100,000 vehicles yearly, the 1965
              Mustang became the most successful vehicle launch since the 1927
              Model A. Introduced on April 17, 1964 (16 days after the Plymouth
              Barracuda), over 400,000 units in its first year; the
              one-millionth Mustang was sold within two years of its launch. In
              August 2018, Ford produced the 10-millionth Mustang; matching the
              first 1965 Mustang, the vehicle was a 2019 Wimbledon White
              convertible with a V8 engine.

          The success of the Mustang launch would lead to multiple competitors
          from other American manufacturers, including the Chevrolet Camaro and
          Pontiac Firebird (1967), AMC Javelin (1968), and Dodge
          Challenger(1970). The Mustang would also have an effect on designs of
          coup√©s worldwide, leading to the marketing of the Toyota Celica and
          Ford Capri in the United States (the latter, by Lincoln-Mercury). The
          Mercury Cougar was launched in 1967 as a higher-trim version of the
          Mustang; during the 1970s, it was repackaged as a personal luxury car.

          For 1965 to 2004, the Mustang shared chassis commonality with other
          Ford model lines, staying rear-wheel drive throughout its production.
          From 1965 to 1973, the Mustang was derived from the 1960 Ford Falcon
          compact. From 1974 to 1978, the Mustang (denoted Mustang II) was a
          longer-wheelbase version of the Ford Pinto. From 1979 to 2004, the
          Mustang shared its Fox platform chassis with 14 other Ford vehicles
          (becoming the final one to use the Fox architecture). Since 2005, Ford
          has produced two generations of the Mustang, each using a distinct
          platform unique to the model line.
