          If you've paid close attention to auto sales over the last few years,
          this isn't really surprising, but it is still stark. Automakers are
          releasing sales results for 2020, and Motor Authority found that Ford
          sold 61,090 Mustangs in 2020, while Chevrolet moved just 29,775 units
          of the Camaro. Both those figures are down around 13 percent when
          compared to 2019, undoubtedly a result of COVID-19. Dodge sold 52,995
          Challengers last year, impressive given that it's a far older model
          than the Camaro and Mustang. That's what constant updates—and big
          V-8s—gets you.

          The street race at St. Petersburg is the traditional IndyCar season
          opener, but COVID-19 forced its postponement to the end of the 2020
          season, and it's already been postponed for the 2021 season. The
          IndyCar series announced yesterday that it's moving the St. Pete race
          to April 25, making the April 11 round at Barber Motorsports Park in
          Alabama the new season opener. "It's not surprising that an event of
          this magnitude, scheduled for the first week of March, is still
          subject to the implications of the pandemic," said Penske
          entertainment boss Mark Miles in a statement.

          Racing Point Formula 1 has officially become Aston Martin for the 2021
          season, and Autosport reports that it has a new title sponsor—American
          IT company Cognizant. BWT, the water treatment company that sponsored
          Racing Point, is leaving the team, and with that, the team's
          distinctive pink livery will likely become all green, reflecting Aston
          Martin's (and Britain's) traditional racing color.
