        <p>
          The Mach-E name is inspired by the Mach 1 variant of the
          first-generation Mustang.
        </p>

        <p>
          Conventional door handles are absent on the Mustang Mach-E, and the
          vehicle instead features buttons that pop open the doors and a small
          door handle protruding from the front doors. Owners can use their
          smartphones as a key as well as a keypad built into the B-pillar. The
          interior has a wide dashboard and built-in soundbar; the dash is
          equipped with a vertically mounted 15.5 in (39 cm) touchscreen
          infotainment system with a rotary dial fixed onto it. The majority of
          the carâ€™s systems are controlled through the screen, which uses Ford's
          recent SYNC 4 operating system that can accept wireless updates. A
          10.2 in (26 cm) digital cluster for the driver is also featured, while
          the steering wheel retains a number of physical buttons.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Mustang Mach-E is built on the Global Electrified 1 (GE1) platform
          which is a heavily reworked version of the C2 platform that is used on
          the fourth generation Focus and third generation Kuga/fourth
          generation Escape. The model will be launched with two battery pack
          sizes and three power outputs. The entry-level rear-wheel drive
          version is offered with either a 68 kWh battery producing 266 hp or a
          88 kWh extended battery producing 290 hp. Both battery packs have a
          claimed 0-60 mph time of 6.1 seconds or less and an EPA range of
          around 211 and 300 miles respectively.
