          The third-generation Mustang was produced by Ford from 1978 until
          1993. Being built on Ford’s Fox platform, it is commonly referred to
          as the Fox body Mustang.

          It evolved through a number of sub-models, trim levels, and drivetrain
          combinations during its production life. It underwent updates for
          1987, and for a time seemed destined for replacement with a
          front-wheel drive Mazda platform. However, company executives were
          swayed by consumer opinion and the rear-wheel drive Mustang stayed,
          while the front wheel drive version was renamed the Ford Probe.

          Enthusiasts group the generation into two segments: the 1979–1986
          cars, with their quad headlight arrangement, and the 1987–1993 cars,
          with their aerodynamic composite headlamps and front fascia styling.
          Production ended with the introduction of the fourth-generation
          Mustang (SN-95) for the 1994 model year.
