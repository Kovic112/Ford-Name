          At launch, three engines were available: a standard aluminum 3.7 L
          "Cyclone" V6, an optional 2.3 L EcoBoost turbocharged, direct-injected
          I4, or a 5.0 L "Coyote" V8.
        </p>

        <p>
          The 2.3 L EcoBoost engine is new to the Mustang, having debuted in the
          2015 model year Lincoln MKC crossover. This four-cylinder includes
          improvements over earlier versions. The 2.3 Ecoboost engine also marks
          the return of a 4-cylinder engine in the Mustang, which were standard
          in cars produced from 1974 to 1993, as well as in the "SVO"
          turbocharged models from 1984 to 1986.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2018, the 5.0 L Coyote V8 engine was updated (2018 (Gen. 3)
          Updates) with a revised intake runners, larger valves and dual
          injection, which utilizes both direct injection and port injection,
          enabling it to run 87 octane (AKI) gasoline with 12:1 high cr ratio.
          The cylinders are now lined with a thinner coating achieved by plasma
          coating, instead of the thicker and heavier traditional cylinder
          sleeves, which results in a slight displacement increase from 4,951cc
          (302 cubic inches) to 5,038cc (307 cubic inches).
