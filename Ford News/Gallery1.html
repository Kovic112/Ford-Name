          The first-generation Ford Mustang was manufactured by Ford from March
          1964 until 1973. The introduction of the Mustang created a new class
          of automobile known as the pony car. The Mustangâ€™s styling, with its
          long hood and short deck, proved wildly popular and inspired a host of
          competition.

          It was initially introduced on April 17, 1964, as a hardtop and
          convertible with the fastback version put on sale in August 1964. At
          the time of its introduction, the Mustang, sharing its platform with
          the Falcon, was slotted into a compact car segment.

          With each revision, the Mustang saw an increase in overall dimensions
          and in engine power. The 1971 model saw a drastic redesign to its
          predecessors. After an initial surge, sales were steadily declining,
          as Ford began working on a new generation Mustang. With the onset of
          the 1973 oil crisis, Ford was prepared, having already designed the
          smaller Mustang II for the 1974 model year. This new car had no common
          components with preceding models.
